# Layered Regulation Across Scales

The architecture in this repository separates regulation into distinct layers:

- **Signals** (A, H, P, T, B) — observable conditions
- **Coherence Band** (Narrowband / Softfold / Openband) — envelope width
- **Switching Ladder** (Clarify / Frame / Options / Direct / Template / Refuse) — response mode
- **Runtime Regulators** (Boundary, Non-Assumption, Exit Discipline, etc.) — stabilizers
- **Constitutional Layer** — non-negotiable constraints

Each layer operates independently while influencing the others.

This separation was not added for complexity.  
It emerged as density increased.

When ambiguity, risk, authority pressure, and scope compete simultaneously, collapse becomes more likely if regulation is handled at a single level. Stability improves when:

- Signals are detected,
- Envelope width is adjusted,
- Mode selection is chosen deliberately,
- Hard constraints remain fixed.

The resulting structure distributes regulation across levels rather than concentrating it in a single decision point.

This repository applies that principle to bounded language generation.

Readers may recognize similar stratification in other complex systems.

No further claim is made.
